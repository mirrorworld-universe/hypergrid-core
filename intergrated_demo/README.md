# Integrated Demo

A comprehensive demonstration that showcases the ability to read and write data accounts from the Solana base layer, with interactive modifications involving data on the Grids. The writable data will be generated by our program deployed on the base layer. This demo will integrate the functionalities of reading program data, reading data accounts, and read/write operations into a single, cohesive presentation.We will implement this demo in a GitHub repository with three layers:

* Base Layer: Code for the program/smart contract deployed on the Solana devnet.

* App Layer: Code that interfaces with Sonic through HyperGrid, written in Rust or TypeScript.

* Docs Layer: A README.md file that describes the nature of the demo. This file should also contain the results of stress testing.
